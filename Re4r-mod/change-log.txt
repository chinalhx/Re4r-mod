v3.003 (2023-03-19):

- Fixed check for 0-byte PAK files when installing mods.
- Changed the "Skip PAK modification" toggle to exist for all games in the mod manager. Note: This used to only exist for MHR and the toggle will be set to its default off setting with this update, so change it if necessary.

v2.254 (2022-09-29):

- MHR: Replaced the integrity check after encrypting/decrypting PAKs that didn't work correctly with official patch PAKs.

- Added a feature that automatically converts TEX and MSG files to the new formats for old RE2, RE3, and RE7 mods.
- Made the mod manager detect game version and mod version, so it can give a warning if user tries to install a mod that's not compatible (this check does not work for RE3 mods that only modify pfb, scn, or pck formats).
- Moved the "Show/hide games" option to the top of the "choose game" menu.
- Fixed a bug where the prompt for installing/uninstalling mods wouldn't show the mod name correctly if there was a '%' symbol in the name.

v2.252: (2022-03-31)

- Fixed a bug that prevented the mod list from being navigable with keyboard letters after selecting "Refresh mod list."
- Added support for installing RE Engine mods packaged as PAK files.

- Fixed alphabetical sorting in "Downloads" menu.
- Added alphabetical sorting to the "choose game" menu.

- Added a warning message if the mod manager is run from WinRAR without being extracted first.
- Made it possible for mods to be categorized as addons for mod addons.

- Fixed a bug that could make Fluffy Manager take a bit more CPU time than it was supposed to.
- RE8: Updated the third person mod to work with the latest RE8 patch (2021/08/10).
- If you add "DisableBlur: 1" to the config file, then the blur effect won't be used anymore in the mod manager (might be useful for troubleshooting).
- Made it possible to uninstall installed mods when path to the game isn't known (this doesn't delete the installed mod files, however).
- You can now bundle mods as one button in the mod list if each mod contains the same "NameAsBundle" entry in the modinfo.ini file.
- Minor fixes.

- Added a message about quantity of files failing to copy if a mod failed to install.
- Added a new toggle to "Advanced options" which makes it possible to re-copy the files for an installed mod while the game is running. This is useful for mod development of RE Engine mods where you can copy over updated versions of modded files without having to restart the game.
- Added another toggle to "Advanced options" which lets you do a "reverse install" of an installed mod. This copies the files for the mod from the game directory to the mod directory. This is for mod development. This toggle can't be on at the same time as the above toggle.
- Added more detailed entries to Data\log.txt related for mod installs and uninstalls.

v2.242: (2020-12-18)

- Added code for outputting error messages for when Curl (library used for version checking and downloads) fails. These error messages are logged to Data\Log.txt
- Re-compiled Curl to allow for downloading from secure websites. Since that's supported now I've changed all addresses to my website to use HTTPS. It's possible only this and newer versions of the Mod Manager will be able to use download functionality, so it's highly recommended all users upgrade to this.
- Added basic functionality for verifying file integrity of downloaded files.
- Improved behaviour when Fluffy Manager window is resized while the mod list is open. However, this is very much a work-in-progress and I'll continue to improve this behaviour so every part of the UI resizes appropriately as you resize the window.

v2.230: (2020-11-23)
- Optimized GPU usage. If nothing is being animated (or if the program is out of focus) then GPU usage becomes 0%.

- Save manager: Added support for more games. RE1 HD, RE0, RE4, RE5, RE6, Revelations 1, and Revelations 2.

- The "Define game path" button now only appears if the mod manager lacks the install path for the currently selected game.
- The mod manager now allows replacement of the game executable. Note that the mod manager can't check if a game is patched while the game executable is replaced, so keep this in mind (you might need to reinstall the game if the game gets patched while you have it modded like this).
- Fixed a rare bug which could lead to the mod manager failing to copy over a file from a second mod when uninstalling a mod which modded the same files as another installed mod.
- Fixed a bug which prevented the "Uninstall all mods" button from updating its state when browsing the addon menu for a mod.
- When clicking on "Uninstall all mods" while browsing the addon menu for a mod you will no longer get reset to the full mod list.
- Improved handling of starting Fluffy Manager 5000 when an instance of it is already running.
- Added a better notification for when mod downloads finish.

- Fixed a bug with Windows 10 version 2004 where quitting the mod manager while it's on a second monitor will make it freeze when restarting the mod manager.
- Added support for the game Ghostrunner.
- Fixed drag'n'drop feature which broke when fixing a bug related to Windows 10 v2004.
- Fixed a bug which could potentially show info about a downloadable mod while in a puzzle minigame.

- There's now a system in place for automating the downloading and updating of new versions of Fluffy Manager.
- Log.txt will now be created in "Data" directory in order to make the root directory for Fluffy Manager less messy. Feel free to delete log.txt if it already exists.

- Fixed an issue where Fluffy Manager would get confused by its focus status if the user changed to another program while Fluffy Manager was initializing (this meant it could be receiving input when it shouldn't).
- Fixed a bug which could make Fluffy Manager think an old version was up-to-date when doing online version checking.
- Clicking on "Refresh mod list" will no longer reset the currently selected category filter.
- Rewrote the framerate limiter as it didn't work very well on newer versions of Windows (this should result in the mod manager feeling a bit more responsive).

v2.220: (2020-05-09)
- Fixed a bug which sometimes prevented the mod author categories from working when browsing downloadable mods.
- Made more games hidden by default (only applies to new users of the mod manager). You can always click "Show / hide games" to customize which games are shown and hidden.
- Fixed a bug which prevented the help icon from appearing.
- Added a lot more help information which can be accessed via pressing the help icon or pressing F1.
- Fixed a bug which could prevent mods in RAR files without a modinfo.ini from appearing in the mod list.
- Added support for multiple mods to be contained in one RAR file (for this to work, you'll need to add multiple subfolders and make sure each one has a modinfo.ini).
- The above feature required a rewrite of a lot of code handling mods in RAR archives. One side effect is that the mod manager will have to re-create the cache for many RAR archives, which could result in a brief delay. If you have mods installed, a few of them might end up getting shown twice in the list (that's fixed by uninstalling and reinstaling the mods).
- The mod manager will now automatically re-read game archives if a game patch is detected while no mods are installed.
- Fixed a bug where if you only had mods with addons in the mod list the mod manager would display the message "no mods found."
- Fixed a bug where the wrong menu button would be pressed after showing a list of mod addons and clicking left mouse button without moving the mouse.
- Added a button to the mod downloader to a site where you can post feedback on the mods downloadable via the mod manager.

- When installing mods, the "invalidated paths" text now says "modified paths."
- Fixed a bug which could result in a mod download failing (happened if a mod with same filename exists and its screenshot was recently loaded).
- The mod manager now refuses to install/uninstall mods for any game if the game is currently running. Add "CheckIfGameIsRunningForModInstalls: 0" to config.ini to override this behaviour.
- SC6: Updated trainer to work with latest patch (works as of 2020/04/16).

v2.210: (2020-04-03)
- Added support for Resident Evil 3 and RE: Resistance.

v2.200: (2020-01-23)
- SC6: Updated the trainer to support "AI difficulty change" and changing of controller IDs with v2.00 of the game (also works with v2.02, and hopefully future versions).
- SC6: Updated the music part of the trainer to include SC4, Broken Destiny, and SC5 soundtracks.
- Improved display of warning when a game is patched while mods are installed.
- RE2: Updated trainer to work with the latest patch.
- Made mod installs using RE Engine games to correctly check against both hashes of each file entry in PAK files. Earlier versions only compared against one hash which prevented 2 files from being modable in DMC5.
- Added "Download Mods" button with some direct mod downloads and some links to popular mod sites. (Since mods can be directly downloaded via the mod manager, I've removed the mods which were bundled with the mod manager.)
- Added Resident Evil 3 support in the mod manager! (but it doesn't actually support RE3 yet)

v2.115: (2019-11-24)
- Made the "Trainer" GUI button lead directly to the "Trainer functions" menu if the trainer has managed to hook into the game.
- Mod manager will no longer display mod conflicts when hovering over an installed mod (might remove some stutter when browsing the mod list).
- Mod manager will skip displaying mod conflicts when hovering over an uninstalled mod with an enormous amount of files (this removes a long stutter which would have happened when browsing the mod list with mods like that).

- RE6: "Player stats" and "Lobby info" trainer menus have been combined into one called "Player info."
- Added option to align menu button text in mod list to "left" or "middle."

- Added "Installed" category to the "Tag filter" menu.
- "Tag filter" menu now shows quantity of mods currently using each category tag.
- Clicking "Mod list" now always resets category tag selection to default (which is "all").
- Screenshot feature. Press F12 key to take a screenshot which will be saved as a PNG file in the "Screenshots" directory.
- SC6: Added a trainer. Lets you change stage music and AI difficulty.
- Fixed a minor issue where a "previous menu" menu button wouldn't work as intended if you opened the trainer menu while in the mod list menu.
- Cleaned up the "Trainer options" menu.
- SC6: Added a wallpaper for the game.
- SC6: Added a feature to the trainer letting you force 1P and 2P to always be human-controlled.

-- *.rtf
-- *.jpg
-- *.jpeg
-- *.psd
-- *.png
-- *.tga
-- *.bmp
-- *.gif
-- *.url
- Fixed a bug which would sometimes lead to mod installs failing due to game archives not being read even when a game was selected without needing game archives read.

v2.112: (2019-08-11)
- Added a warning if the mod manager loads a modinfo.ini in unicode format (this is not supported, and those should always be saved as ANSI).

-- The "main menu" is now a series of always-visible buttons to the right.
-- The mod manager now defaults to showing the mod list when starting.
- Made it possible to drag'n'drop mod RAR files directly onto the Mod Manager window which makes it move the RAR file into the corresponding directory for currently selected game.
- For UE4 games (ie, Bloodstained and SoulCalibur 6), you can drag'n'drop a PAK file onto the Mod Manager window.

v2.000: (2019-06-06)

- Mod manager now does a basic check if the currently selected game has been patched. If that happens, the mod manager will display a message about recommended steps if a conflict could have happened with the patch and mod installs.
- Added a toggle to options to change how the mod list is presented. Alternate style gives the mod list static size to all buttons (but they'll resize to show all text when highlighted).
- Mod manager will now show a warning if you're highlighting a mod with conflicting files as a currently installed mod.
- Increased the maximum amount of mods possible to be listed in one menu (from 1k to 20k).
